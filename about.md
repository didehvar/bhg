The Bounty Huntersâ€™ Guild came from a necessity across the Galaxy and is led by an elite group of game's best players. All within the guild are committed to Only 1 simple rule: collect a daily bounty of 600 raid tickets. 

Its rules are the laws that keep bounty hunters together, anyone who breaks the rules are held in disregard and are quickly removed from the guild.

#### Organization

The core of the Bounty Huntersâ€™ Guild is made up of eleven major houses that operate nearly independently, but are held together by the overarching Bounty Huntersâ€™ Guild. Each house has its own organization, regulation, specialties and agendas. Line and Discord are used for communication as these forces operate across the galaxy. The major Houses are:
