The Bounty Hunters’ Guild came from a necessity across the Galaxy and is led by an elite group of game's best players. All within the guild are committed to receiving a daily bounty of 600 tickets by completing numerous challenges. This submission of tickets is of upmost importance and forms a part of the Bounty Hunters’ Creed, the unwritten rules of the bounty hunters. 

Its rules are the laws that keep bounty hunters together, anyone who breaks the rules are held in disregard and are quickly removed from the guild.

#### Organization

The core of the Bounty Hunters’ Guild is made up of nine major houses that operate nearly independently, but are held together by the overarching Bounty Hunters’ Guild. Each house has its own organization, regulation, specialties and agendas. Line and Discord are used for communication as these forces operate across the galaxy. The major Houses are:

* House Salaktori (specialized in raiding in all areas of the galaxy)
* Epidemic (Specialized in raiding in Europe)
* Shot First (Specialized in raiding in Europe)
* Squad Goals (Specialized in raiding in the US)
