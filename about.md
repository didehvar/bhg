The Bounty Hunters' Guild was an ancient institution that regulated the bounty-hunting trade. It was led by a guildmaster who held members to the Bounty Hunters' Creed, the unwritten rules of the bounty hunters. Its rules were the laws that kept bounty hunters together, but the guild was full of loose cannons, who would often break the rules for their own benefit. The guild was more a coalition of the professionals than a proper organization, and rivalries between its houses were a common occurrence. The bounty hunters who joined the guild had the benefit of notifications of bounty postings before they were broadcast through official channels, which gave guild members a head start. Many Imperial agents preferred to deal exclusively with guild bounty hunters.

#### Organization

The Bounty Hunters' Guild was composed of many smaller guilds that operated nearly independently. Those guilds were loosely held together by the overarching Bounty Hunters' Guild, each with its own organization, regulation, specialties and agendas. The core of the Bounty Hunters' Guild is made up of ten major houses along with a number of smaller groups, each specializing in a unique brand of bounty hunting, but reporting to the guildmaster. Those major Houses were:

* Crimson Nova (specialized in Jedi)
* House of Benelex (specialized in kidnapping retrieval)
* House of Neuvalis (rarely dealt with outsiders)
* House of Paramexor (specialized in hunting murderers)
* House of Renliss (consisted of female hunters pursuing male bounties)
* House of Salaktori (the most elite and prominent house)
* House of Tresario (specialized in hunting pirates)
* Mantis Syndicate (specialized in big groups)
* Ragnar Syndicate (specializing in unorthodox techniques)
* Skine Bounty Hunter College (specialists, who were top at variety of things)
* Slaver Syndicate (sometimes turned their bounties over to slavers)
